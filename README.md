FAQ:
User query   :  What is added sugar, and why is it not healthy in food?
Bot Response : Unlike foods and drinks that naturally contain sugar, those with added sugar provide no nutritional value.

		Consuming too much may cause health problems over time. This article discusses five reasons why added sugars are bad for your health.
