FAQ:
User query   :  What is added sugar, and why is it not healthy in food?
Bot Response : Unlike foods and drinks that naturally contain sugar, those with added sugar provide no nutritional value.
		They are also a poor energy source, as the body digests added sugar very quickly.
		Consuming too much may cause health problems over time. This article discusses five reasons why added sugars are bad for your health.

User query   : Are there common areas of weight gain in men’s and women’s bodies as they age?
